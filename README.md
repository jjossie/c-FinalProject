# CSE220c - C++ Language: Final Project
Week 6 // Final Project for C++ Language Class

This is a console-based Soduku Game I made. It uses Classes for Coordinates (so they can be validated upon construction) and a Board, as well as Structs for Moves and Squares. Features include:
* Save to a text file
* Load from a text file
* Unlimited move undo (for current session)
* List all possible moves for a given square
* Three included boards: "easy.txt", "medium.txt", and "hard.txt".
